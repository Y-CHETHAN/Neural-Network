# BINARY CLASSIFICATION
## AIM:
To write a python program to perform binary classification.

## EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner /Google Colab

## RELATED THEORITICAL CONCEPT:
Binary classification is a form of classification — the process of predicting categorical variables — where the output is restricted to two classes.
It is used in many different data science applications, such as Medical Diagnosis, Email analysis, Marketing, etc.
For example, in medical diagnosis, a binary classifier for a specific disease could take in symptoms of a patient and predict whether the patient is healthy or has a disease. The possible outcomes of the diagnosis are positive and negative.
